=head1 DESCRIPTION

Resource map provider for L<cert-manager|https://cert-manager.io/> Custom
Resource Definitions. Registers 6 CRD classes covering C<cert-manager.io/v1>
and C<acme.cert-manager.io/v1>, modeled to full depth: C<spec> (and, where
upstream declares one, C<status>) is a typed object graph of 71 further
C<IO::K8s::CertManager::V1::*> classes, one per upstream Go structure, named
after the upstream Go types
(L<IO::K8s::CertManager::V1::Certificate|IO::K8s::CertManager::V1::Certificate>'s
C<issuerRef> is an
L<IO::K8s::CertManager::V1::IssuerReference|IO::K8s::CertManager::V1::IssuerReference>,
and so on down) rather than an opaque hashref. Embedded core and Gateway API
types are referenced, not re-modeled. A Go type used by more than one Kind
(C<SecretKeySelector>, C<IssuerReference>, C<LocalObjectReference>,
C<ServiceAccountRef>, the whole C<ACMEChallengeSolver> family) is one shared
class, not a copy per Kind -- most notably C<IssuerSpec>/C<IssuerStatus>
themselves, the literal same Go types embedded by both C<Issuer> and
C<ClusterIssuer>, so those two Kinds share their entire spec/status tree.

Not loaded by default — opt in via the C<with> constructor parameter of
L<IO::K8s> or by calling C<< $k8s->add('IO::K8s::CertManager') >> at runtime.

=head2 Included CRDs (cert-manager.io/v1)

=over 4

=item * C<Certificate> (namespaced) -- a human-readable request that an up to date,
signed X.509 certificate be kept stored in the Kubernetes Secret named in
C<spec.secretName>.

=item * C<CertificateRequest> (namespaced) -- the single-shot request cert-manager
generates from a C<Certificate> to actually obtain one signed certificate from the
referenced issuer; disposable, and re-created on each renewal.

=item * C<Issuer> (namespaced) -- a certificate-issuing authority (ACME, CA, Vault,
self-signed, ...), usable only by C<Certificate>s in its own namespace.

=item * C<ClusterIssuer> (cluster-scoped) -- the same issuer abstraction as C<Issuer>,
but referenceable from C<Certificate>s in any namespace. C<Issuer> and C<ClusterIssuer>
embed the identical upstream C<IssuerSpec>/C<IssuerStatus> Go types, which is why this
distribution models them as one shared spec/status class tree (see above).

=back

=head2 Included CRDs (acme.cert-manager.io/v1)

=over 4

=item * C<Order> (namespaced) -- represents a single ACME certificate order, created
automatically once a C<CertificateRequest> referencing an ACME issuer exists.

=item * C<Challenge> (namespaced) -- represents one ACME challenge (HTTP-01, DNS-01,
...) that must be completed to authorize a single DNS name/identifier within an
C<Order>.
