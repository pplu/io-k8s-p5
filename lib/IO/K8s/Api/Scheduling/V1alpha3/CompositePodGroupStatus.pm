=attr conditions

conditions represent the latest observations of the CompositePodGroup's state.

Known condition types: - "CompositePodGroupInitiallyScheduled": Indicates whether the overall scheduling requirement
  for the subtree under this CompositePodGroup has been satisfied. Once this condition
  transitions to True, it serves as a terminal state and will never revert to False,
  even if pods are subsequently deleted and group constraints are no longer met.
- "DisruptionTarget": Indicates whether the CompositePodGroup is about to be terminated
  due to disruption such as preemption.

Known reasons for the CompositePodGroupInitiallyScheduled condition: - "Unschedulable": The CompositePodGroup's subtree could not be placed due to resource constraints,
  affinity/anti-affinity, or topological constraints.
- "SchedulerError": The CompositePodGroup cannot be scheduled due to some internal error
  that occurred during scheduling.
- "Invalid": Set to True when kube-scheduler detects an invalid group layout during
  runtime validation. The `message` field details the specific layout violation (such as
  a detected cycle, exceeding the maximum depth of 4, or referencing multiple distinct Workloads).

Known reasons for the DisruptionTarget condition: - "PreemptionByScheduler": The CompositePodGroup was targeted by the scheduler's preemption loop
  to free up capacity for higher-priority preemptors.
