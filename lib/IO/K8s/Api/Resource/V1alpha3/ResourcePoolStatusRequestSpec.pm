# ABSTRACT: ResourcePoolStatusRequestSpec defines the filters for the pool status request.

k8s defaultPartitionTypeAttribute => Str;

=attr defaultPartitionTypeAttribute

DefaultPartitionTypeAttribute optionally names a device attribute (by its fully qualified name, e.g. "gpu.example.com/profile") to use as the default grouping attribute for partitionable devices whose slice has not declared one themselves.

A slice's own PartitionTypeAttribute always takes precedence. This default applies only to devices whose slice does not declare one, so that a request can still get an accurate partitionSummary from a driver that has not been updated to declare it. When neither the slice nor this default names an attribute, a partitionable pool reports no partitionSummary.

Must include the domain qualifier.

=cut

k8s driver => Str, 'required';

=attr driver

Driver specifies the DRA driver name to filter pools. Only pools from ResourceSlices with this driver will be included. Must be a DNS subdomain (e.g., "gpu.example.com").

=cut

k8s limit => Int;

=attr limit

Limit optionally specifies the maximum number of pools to return in the status. If more pools match the filter criteria, the response will be truncated (i.e., len(status.pools) < status.poolCount).

Default: 100. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 1000.

=cut

k8s poolName => Str;

=attr poolName

PoolName optionally filters to a specific pool name. If not specified, all pools from the specified driver are included. When specified, must be a non-empty valid resource pool name (DNS subdomains separated by "/").
